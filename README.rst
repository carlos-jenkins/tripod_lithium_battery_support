A 3D printable quick release plate for the Dolica ST-500 or compatible tripods
that allows to place a long lasting lithium battery (usb power pack) on the
quick release bay.

Then a GoPro can be placed on top of the battery using standard GoPro adhesive
mounts so that it can be powered by the battery for almost infinite recording
(your SD card will fill before the battery dies).


Quick Release Plate
===================

Quick release plates aren't standardized, so this object will only work on
Dolica ST-500 or compatible tripods that supports the following plate format:

- `Dolica ST-500 Quick Release Plate <http://www.dolica.com/quick-release-plate/st500-q-for-st-500>`_.

This includes the Dolica ST-500 obviously but maybe also the famous
AmazonBasics 60-Inch Lightweight Tripod (although this couldn't be confirmed):

- `Dolica ST-500 <https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001DELTLQ/>`_.
- `AmazonBasics 60-Inch Lightweight Tripod with Bag <https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005KP473Q/>`_.


Battery support
===============

The battery support is 55mm x 90mm x 4mm (customizable in the OpenSCAD file)
so it can hold a large lithium battery. The ones tested are:

- `Jackery Giant+ 12000 mAh Battery <https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EA1P8OI>`_.

It is expected that the battery is held in place by the use of double sided
tape mounting tape between the support flat side and the battery.

To finalize the assembly, standard GoPro Adhesive Mounts can be placed on top
of the battery to install the camera.
